# Development Process Logs

This folder contains detailed session logs documenting the development journey of DocPal.

## 📁 File Naming Convention

Each development session is documented in a separate file named by date:

```
YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

**Example:** `2025-12-20.md`

## 📝 What Goes in Each Log

Each session log should include:

### Required Sections
- **Session Goals** - What we planned to accomplish
- **Completed Tasks** - Detailed breakdown of work done
- **Architecture Decisions** - Important technical choices made
- **Current State** - Snapshot of what's implemented
- **Issues Resolved** - Problems encountered and solutions
- **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways from the session
- **Next Steps** - What's coming next

### Optional Sections (as needed)
- **File Structure** - Major file organization changes
- **Technical Debt & TODOs** - Items to address later
- **Key Achievements** - Major milestones reached
- **Documentation Updated** - What docs were changed

## 🎯 Purpose

These logs serve multiple purposes:

1. **Development History** - Track how the project evolved over time
2. **Decision Context** - Understand why certain choices were made
3. **Knowledge Base** - Reference for similar problems in the future
4. **Onboarding** - Help new team members understand the codebase
5. **Progress Tracking** - See what's been accomplished

## 📊 Current Sessions

- **2025-12-20** - Foundation & Menu System
  - Slug-based routing implementation
  - Nested drag & drop menu system
  - Component refactoring (910 lines → 3 components)
  - Resizable sidebar with el-splitter
  - UX enhancements with animations

## 💡 Tips for Writing Sessions

1. **Be Detailed**: Future you will appreciate the context
2. **Include Code Snippets**: Show implementation examples
3. **Document Decisions**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. **List File Changes**: Track what was modified/created/deleted
5. **Capture Problems**: Document issues and their solutions
6. **Update Regularly**: Write as you go, not at the end
